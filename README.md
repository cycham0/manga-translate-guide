# Manga translate guideline

# Information
- This is a sample with guideline of how to run [manga-image-translator](https://github.com/zyddnys/manga-image-translator) in Google Colab.
- It works nice with Colab A1000 GPU (T4 GPU of course work too but slow), I tried to use TPU before, but TPU does not suitable to the code.
- The sample colab ipynb file is made on 13 Apr 2025, it may not work if the manga-image-translator has any updated.
- Google Colab plan I am using is "Pay As You Go", I am not sure if the any free credit anymore now, please check youself or pay for it.
- Remarks: The manga-image-translator.ipynb is just a sample, and it works on my computer:D
- Details please visit https://github.com/zyddnys/manga-image-translator/blob/main/README.md, there are Englush and Chinese detail guidelines
- Ok, let's go!
